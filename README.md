# Portfolio Page

This is my **Portfolio** website built with the **React** framework, **React-Bootstrap**, and **Bootstrap CSS**. It showcases my professional experience, skills, and projects in a modern and responsive layout.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create dynamic components and manage the app's state.
- **React-Bootstrap**: Bootstrap components for React, enabling the use of pre-styled UI components with React-specific features.
- **Bootstrap CSS**: A popular front-end framework used for creating responsive, mobile-first designs quickly and easily.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is fully responsive, adapting to all screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
- **Interactive Experience**: Includes sections like About Me, Skills, Professional Experience, and Contact with smooth UI components powered by React-Bootstrap.
- **Contact Form**: A simple contact form that allows users to send messages (using a backend service like EmailJS or your preferred option for handling contact forms).

## Contact Form

The contact form currently uses **React-Bootstrap** form components. When the form is submitted, it triggers an email sending action using an external service (you can configure a service like **EmailJS**, **Formspree**, or any backend service you prefer).

## Deployment

You can deploy this portfolio site using platforms like:

- **Netlify**: Supports easy deployment with GitHub integration.
- **Vercel**: Fast and seamless deployment for React apps.
- **GitHub Pages**: Deploy your app directly from your GitHub repository.

## Customization

You can easily customize the following aspects of this portfolio:

- **Content**: Modify the data in the `src/assests/data` folder for your personal details, experience, skills, and projects.
- **Styling**: Update the styles in `src/styles/main.css` or use **React-Bootstrap** themes to change the look and feel.
- **Contact Form**: If you want to integrate your own backend for handling contact form submissions, replace the existing form handler with your backend API.
